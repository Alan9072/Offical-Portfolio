# Official Portfolio Website üëç
This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a showcase for my skills, projects, and services. The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. It features several sections, including a home page, an about me section, a portfolio of my projects, and a section highlighting the services I offer. The site also includes links to my contact information. I have deployed the website using GitHub Pages for easy access and to demonstrate my web development capabilities.
